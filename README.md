Description:  
"Tic Tac Toe" displays a grid and two gesture controllable views for users to be able to play tic tac toe locally with their friends.  

Learning Topics:  
Gesture Recognizers, UIBezierPath to draw custom images  

Features Checklist (In Progress):  
üìù Required Features:  
‚úÖ Create a subclass of UIView called GridView. Override the draw(_ rect: CGRect) function and use UIBezierPath to draw a grid (ie. 2 horizontal and 2 vertical lines).  
‚úÖ Add the GridView to your storyboard by dragging out a view and setting the custom class to GridView.  
‚úÖ Add nine square subviews to the ViewController to represent each square in the grid.  
‚úÖ Add an outlet collection linking to each square subview in viewController.
‚úÖ Add UILabel or UIImageViews for the X and O pieces (make sure to enable user interaction after adding)  
‚úÖ Add a UIGestureRecognizer to each piece so the user can drag them around the screen  
‚úÖ Create a UIView subclass called InfoView and add a label and button  
‚úÖ Add rounded corners, a border color, and aborder width to the InfoView view by overriding awakeFromNib() and CALayer.  
‚úÖ Add info button. When user taps, update infoView text to instructions and animate infoView to move from offscreen to center of screen.  
‚úÖ When user taps "OK" button in infoVoew, animate infoView to from center of screen to offscreen. Reset the infoView to above screen to reset for future animations.  
‚úÖ "X" piece starts the game.  
‚úÖ Set piece whose turn it is to alpha of 1.  
‚úÖ Use an animation to show to user(s) whose turn it is. User interaction is disabled until animation is completed.  
‚úÖ When user drops piece on unoccupied tile, animate the piece "snapping" in place on the grid.  
‚úÖ When user drops piece on a location outside the grid, animate the piece "snapping" back to starting position on the grid.  
‚úÖ When a piece occupies a spot on the grid, make sure it is no longer user interactable (NOTE: In my implementation, I don't leave the game piece on the grid. Instead, I unhide the square view and set their text & appearance to match the piece that was placed there. Then, I hide the original game piece and move it back to its original spot. See my viewController for more details.)
