Description:  
"Tic Tac Toe" displays a grid and two gesture controllable views for users to be able to play tic tac toe locally with their friends.  

Learning Topics:  
Gesture Recognizers, UIBezierPath to draw custom images, Model View Controller division of responsibilities,  Custom Views    

Features Checklist:  
üìù Required Features:  
‚úÖ Create a subclass of UIView called GridView. Override the draw(_ rect: CGRect) function and use UIBezierPath to draw a grid (ie. 2 horizontal and 2 vertical lines).  
‚úÖ Add the GridView to your storyboard by dragging out a view and setting the custom class to GridView.  
‚úÖ Add nine square subviews to the ViewController to represent each square in the grid.  
‚úÖ Add an outlet collection linking to each square subview in viewController.
‚úÖ Add UILabel or UIImageViews for the X and O pieces (make sure to enable user interaction after adding).  
‚úÖ Add a UIGestureRecognizer to each piece so the user can drag them around the screen.  
‚úÖ Create a UIView subclass called InfoView and add a label and button.  
‚úÖ Add rounded corners, a border color, and aborder width to the InfoView view by overriding awakeFromNib() and CALayer.  
‚úÖ Add info button. When user taps, update infoView text to instructions and animate infoView to move from offscreen to center of screen.  
‚úÖ When user taps "OK" button in infoVoew, animate infoView to from center of screen to offscreen. Reset the infoView to above screen to reset for future animations.  
‚úÖ "X" piece starts the game.  
‚úÖ Set piece whose turn it is to alpha of 1.  
‚úÖ Use an animation to show to user(s) whose turn it is. User interaction is disabled until animation is completed.  
‚úÖ When user drops piece on unoccupied tile, animate the piece "snapping" in place on the grid.  
‚úÖ When user drops piece on a location outside the grid, animate the piece "snapping" back to starting position on the grid.  
‚úÖ When a piece occupies a spot on the grid, make sure it is no longer user interactable (NOTE: In my implementation, I don't leave the game piece on the grid. Instead, I unhide the square view and set their text & appearance to match the piece that was placed there. Then, I hide the original game piece and move it back to its original spot. See my viewController for more details.)  
‚úÖ When a player's turn ends, set their piece's alpha property to 0.5 and disable user interaction.  
‚úÖ Check for a win or tie at the end of every turn.  
‚úÖ When a player wins or the game ties, animate the infoView coming down from above the screen with text indicating who won or if there was a tie. Tapping the button should animate the infoView moving off the screen again.  
‚úÖ After a win or tie and the infoView is dismissed, animate the pieces on the board fading away.  
‚úÖ Start a new game after a game is completed. X should go first.  
‚úÖ Create a grid class to use as a model to store the grid data.  
‚úÖ Initialize an instance of the grid class in the main viewController.swift file to keep track of the grid.  
‚úÖ Grid has a function to check if a square is occupied.  
‚úÖ Grid has a function to check if there is a winner, and returns who the winner is.  
‚úÖ Grid has a function to check if there is a tie.  
‚úÖ Grid has a function to mark a square as occupied.  
‚úÖ Grid has a function to clear the grid.  
‚úÖ Add a loading screen that contains the name of the app and your UC ID.  
‚úÖ Add a properly sized app icon.  

üåü Bonus Features:  
‚ùå Add an animation to show how the winner won that clears after completing.  

Unresolved:  
‚ùå Minor glitch: Piece appears to "bounce" back to original spot when re-appearing after placing on grid.
